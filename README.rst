============================
Plug - *Python Chess Engine*
============================

************
Introduction
************

This is an attempt to create a Chess Engine in Python.
The main intention is to understand various steps involved to create a chess engine.

There are two main sources for information on Chess Programming - `GameDev.net's Chess Programming <http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/artificial-intelligence/chess-programming-part-i-getting-started-r1014>`_
and `Chess Programming Wiki <chessprograming.wikispaces.com>`_.

Chess Programming Wiki is quite elaborate and it is the ultimate resource. However when starting (and on a tight schedule) it isn't ideal. The article on Game Dev forums is much better. Hence we shall be starting with Game Dev, once solid understanding has been reached - We can go back to look for cracks in our understanding & program, and improve upon them using CP Wiki.

***************
Milestones
***************    

**Plug** will be designed in progresive steps. Each step will depend on the code from previous step. Below are the milestones - 

BitBoard
==========

This section deals with creating a Bitboard and related data.
